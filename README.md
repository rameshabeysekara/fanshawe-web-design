# Q3: (Design Principles)

Proximity: The navigation menu items are grouped together in the top navigation bar, In the contact form, labels and input fields are placed together in rows, creating a clear relationship between each label and its corresponding input.

Typography: The selection of fonts, 'Montserrat' for body text and 'Playfair' for headings, creating a harmonious yet distinctive typography hierarchy. Varying font sizes for different heading levels (h1 and h2) to establish a clear hierarchy and visual interest.

Repetition: Using a consistent color scheme (#761a50, #188f9a, #004f80) across different sections. Applying a consistent font family ('Montserrat' and 'Playfair') for all text elements.

Contrast: The use of different background colors for the top navigation bar (#761a50) and the main content area (#fff), creating a clear distinction between them.

# Q4: (Accessibility)

Semantic HTML elements have been used appropriately to structure the content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the content hierarchy and present it in a meaningful way to users.

Alternative Text for Images: Images in the website have been provided with descriptive alt text (alt attribute) to convey their purpose and content to users who are visually impaired or have images disabled.

Form Accessibility: The contact form fields have appropriate labels (label elements) associated with input fields. This improves form accessibility by helping screen readers identify and announce the purpose of each input.

Keyboard Navigation: The use of tabindex attributes in the form fields and submit button ensures that users can navigate through the form using the keyboard alone, which is essential for users who rely on keyboard navigation or have motor disabilities.

Responsive Design: The media query and responsive design practices used in the CSS ensure that the website is adaptable to various screen sizes and devices. This is crucial for users who access the website using different devices, including mobile devices and screen readers.

Semantic Footer: The footer section contains descriptive content that explains the purpose of the website. This information is useful for all users and particularly important for those relying on screen readers.

# Q5: (Search Engine Optimization)

Meta Tags: The HTML code includes meta tags in the head section, such as meta name="keywords" and meta name="description". These meta tags help search engines understand the content and context of the website, improving its chances of appearing in relevant search results.

Keywords in Content: The content of the website includes relevant keywords like "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," and "computer brain." These keywords can help the website rank higher in search results for relevant queries.

Descriptive Image Alt Text: Images have been given descriptive alt text, which not only improves accessibility but also provides context to search engines about the images' content.

Responsive Design: The use of responsive design ensures that the website is mobile-friendly, which is a factor considered by search engines when ranking websites.

Footer Content: The footer contains copyright information and a brief description of Artificial Intelligence, which can provide additional context to search engines.
