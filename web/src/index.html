                  <b>Definition of AI:</b><br />
                  Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human
                  intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn,
                  and perform tasks autonomously. AI systems can analyze data,
                  recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve their
                  performance over time without explicit programming.

                  <b>Historical context and milestones:</b> <br />The concept of
                  AI has its roots in ancient myths and legends, but modern AI
                  research began in the 1950s. Key milestones include the
                  development of the first AI program, the Dartmouth Conference,
                  the invention of expert systems, and breakthroughs in machine
                  learning and neural networks.

                  <b>Importance and applications of AI:</b><br />
                  AI has become a transformative technology with applications in
                  various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation,
                  gaming, education, and more. AI's potential to streamline
                  processes, optimizes decision-making, and enhance human
                  capabilities makes it indispensable in the modern world.

                <p>
                  <b>Narrow AI (Weak AI) vs. General AI (Strong AI):</b><br />
                  Narrow AI refers to AI systems designed for specific tasks,
                  such as image recognition or language translation. General AI,
                  on the other hand, would possess human-like intelligence and
                  the ability to perform any intellectual task a human can.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Reactive machines:</b><br />
                  Reactive AI systems can only react to specific situations and
                  do not have memory or learning capabilities. They make
                  decisions based solely on the current input and predefined
                  rules.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Limited memory AI:</b><br />
                  These AI systems can learn from historical data and make
                  predictions based on past experiences, allowing them to
                  improve their performance over time.

                <p>
                  <b>Theory of mind AI:</b><br />
                  This hypothetical form of AI would have an understanding of
                  human emotions, beliefs, and intentions, enabling more
                  sophisticated interactions with humans.

                  <b>Self-aware AI:</b> <br />A theoretical concept of AI with
                  self-awareness and understanding of its own existence, similar
                  to human self-awareness.
